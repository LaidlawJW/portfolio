                <div class="box"> The main problems that I encountered with the dice program were getting the "total" text to appear correctly, and allowing the mouse press to randomly roll the dice. I fixed the roll issue by using a random number generator (from one to six) in a method called roll() to determine what each dice should roll as, and then calling the draw() method again when the mouse was pressed. The method draw() is where each dice rolls, adds to the total, and then displays the dice drawings. The "total" text issue was successfully resolved by calling notroke(), drawing a rectangle with the same color as the background, and then displaying the total as text over the rectangle. This prevented the text from layering on top of itself over and over again.</div>
