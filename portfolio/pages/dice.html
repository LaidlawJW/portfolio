                <div class="box"> The main problems that I encountered with the dice program were getting the "total" text to appear correctly, and allowing the mouse press to randomly roll the dice. I fixed the roll issue by using a random number generator (from one to six) in a method called roll() to determine what each dice should roll as, and then calling the draw() method again when the mouse was pressed. The method draw() is where each dice rolls, adds to the total, and then displays the dice drawings. The "total" text issue was successfully resolved (in the Java version only) by setting the total to zero, and then calling background() again at the top of the draw() method. Unfortunatley, I could not manage to recreate this soluiton in the JavaScript version, which is why the total doesn't appear on this page. </div>
