Searching for memories
Throughout our journeys
That make life a little more feathery

Reaching out to others
Throughout our journeys
And feeling more like brothers

Knowing that all things come to an end
Throughout our journeys
Yet finding new ways to make a friend

A helping hand when youâ€™re feeling low
Compelling enough to make us glow
Throughout our journeys

Throughout our journeys
Advice hastily but honestly given 
Finds a way to keep us driven

An entire world to see
But only choosing what makes us feel free
Throughout our journeys
